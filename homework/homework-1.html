<h1>Whales</h1>

<p>
  Wikipedia tells us this about <strong>whales</strong>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Whale is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacea.
  The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it excludes
  dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales).
  This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale.
  The other cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales),
  comprises filter feeders who eat small organisms caught by straining seawater
  through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen.
  This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback whale,
  the bowhead whale and the minke whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins,
  a tail with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes) on top of the head.

<h2>Whale Anatomy</h2>

<p>
  Whales have a couple of pretty cool body parts.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Appendages:
    </strong>
    The body shape is fusiform and the modified forelimbs, or fins, are paddle-shaped.
    The end of the tail is composed of two flukes, which propel the animal by vertical movement,
    as opposed to the horizontal movement of a fish tail. Although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs,
    some (such as sperm whales and baleen whales) possess discrete rudimentary appendages,
    which may contain feet and digits. Most species have a dorsal fin.

    <strong>
      Dentition:
    </strong>
    Toothed whales, such as the sperm whale, possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells.
    Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum,
    whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth,
    does enamel show
